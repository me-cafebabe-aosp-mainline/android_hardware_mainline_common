# Mainline audio HAL

A generic Android audio HAL (AIDL `android.hardware.audio.core` V4) for devices
that run a mainline Linux kernel. Instead of a per-SoC mixer configuration it
builds on the standard Linux audio user space:

* **alsa-lib** (`external/mainline-hw-deps/alsa-lib`) for card enumeration,
  PCM I/O and mixer access, and
* **alsa-ucm-conf** (`external/mainline-hw-deps/alsa-ucm-conf`) for the
  routing knowledge ("Speaker", "Headphones", "HDMI1", ... and the mixer
  sequences that switch between them).

Verification status, known issues and what is left: `TODO.md`.

The HAL is packaged as a vendor APEX (`com.android.hardware.audio.mainline`).
It provides the core HAL only; the effect HAL (`IFactory/default`) is expected
to come from the device, for instance the legacy effect library wrapper in
[`../effect/legacy`](../effect/legacy/README.md). The unmodified AIDL effect
service of the AOSP example HAL can be bundled instead, see `internal_effects`
below.

## Product integration

```makefile
# The HAL lives in the hardware/mainline/common Soong namespace.
PRODUCT_SOONG_NAMESPACES += hardware/mainline/common

PRODUCT_PACKAGES += com.android.hardware.audio.mainline

# An effect HAL, since the APEX does not carry one by default. Either the
# wrapper for the device's legacy effect libraries ...
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += android.hardware.audio.effect.service-aidl.legacy
# ... or the bundled example one, by setting internal_effects below.

# UCM profiles: install everything (generic images) ...
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += alsa-ucm-conf-all
# ... or only the card(s) of the device, see
# external/mainline-hw-deps/alsa-ucm-conf/README.md for the module names.
# PRODUCT_PACKAGES += alsa-ucm-conf-card-sof-hda-dsp
```

The APEX `required`s the alsa-lib configuration database (`/vendor/etc/alsa`)
and the UCM top-level files (`alsa-ucm-conf-base`); card profiles are the
product's choice.

Optional build time switches (Soong config namespace `mainline_audio`):

```makefile
# Leave the Bluetooth audio module and the bundled IBluetoothAudioProviderFactory
# out of the APEX, e.g. because the device ships its own Bluetooth audio HAL.
$(call soong_config_set_bool,mainline_audio,disable_bluetooth,true)

# Bundle an effect HAL (IFactory/default, the example effect service and its
# plug-ins) into the APEX. Off by default: the device is expected to provide
# its own, e.g. the legacy effect library wrapper in ../effect/legacy. Set this
# only when the device has no effect HAL of its own, and never together with
# one: exactly one IFactory/default may be installed.
$(call soong_config_set_bool,mainline_audio,internal_effects,true)

# Offer DTS-HD (incl. Master Audio) and Dolby TrueHD for HDMI passthrough,
# packed by FFmpeg (external/ffmpeg, LGPL-2.1: its libavformat, libavcodec and
# libavutil go into the APEX as shared libraries; the product has to meet the
# LGPL's conditions for them). FFmpeg is built for 64-bit only. Off by default.
$(call soong_config_set_bool,mainline_audio,ffmpeg_passthrough,true)
```

### Things the device still has to provide

* **SELinux.** The HAL runs in the stock `hal_audio_default` domain. It needs
  read/write access to `/dev/snd/*` (`audio_device`, granted by the platform
  policy), read access to `/vendor/etc/alsa` (`vendor_configs_file`) and to
  `/sys/class/sound/*` (used by UCM to find the kernel driver name), and read
  access to the `vendor.audio.mainline.*` properties.
* **Jack detection.** The HAL exposes wired headphones / headsets / line out as
  *external* device ports; the framework has to report their connection. On a
  mainline kernel the sound card exposes jacks as input devices with
  `SW_HEADPHONE_INSERT` / `SW_MICROPHONE_INSERT` / `SW_LINEOUT_INSERT`, so set
  `config_useDevInputEventForAudioJack=true` in the device's framework
  overlay. HDMI is an external template too: `WiredAccessoryManager` connects
  it when the kernel reports an HDMI / DisplayPort sink, either through an
  input device reporting `SW_LINEOUT_INSERT` + `SW_VIDEOOUT_INSERT` together
  (the `SND_JACK_AVOUT` jack of the HDA HDMI codec and of ASoC `hdmi-codec`,
  with the above overlay) or through the Android specific
  `/sys/class/switch/hdmi_audio` (or `hdmi`) switch node. Without either,
  HDMI audio is never selected automatically; see "Device model".
  When a card has multiple HDMI / DP PCMs, the HAL reads their ALSA jack
  controls to route the connected HDMI template to a plugged head. UCM's
  `JackControl` is used when present; without UCM, HDA-style
  `HDMI/DP,pcm=N Jack` controls are used. The framework still needs to report
  HDMI availability as above.
* **AC97 front panels** (`card.<selector>.ac97_front_panel`). The HAL changes
  the front jack pins through `/sys/class/sound/hwC<card>D<codec>/`
  (`user_pin_configs`, then `reconfig`), which needs the kernel options
  `SND_HDA_HWDEP` and `SND_HDA_RECONFIG`, write access for the `audio` group
  (ueventd) and an SELinux label the HAL may write
  (`device/mainline/common` has both). A reconfiguration rebuilds the codec's
  controls and PCM devices, so it only succeeds while nothing has the card
  open; the HAL does it at start, before it opens the card, and on every
  start puts the pins back when the setting is off. Only pins whose location
  is the front panel change. The kernel forgets the change at reboot, so the
  HAL applies it at every start.
* **Real-time scheduling for FAST.** With `fast_latency_ms` the stream worker
  of the primary output asks for `SCHED_FIFO`. The rc file grants
  `SYS_NICE` and an `rtprio` limit, and the platform policy already allows
  `sys_nice` to every audio HAL server domain
  (`system/sepolicy/private/hal_audio.te`), so nothing needs to be added to
  the device's policy. Per SoC values of `fast_latency_ms` belong in the
  device (or SoC common) configuration, e.g. through
  `PRODUCT_VENDOR_PROPERTIES`.
* **HDMI passthrough controls.** The sound card has to expose the sink's
  `ELD` and an `IEC958 Playback Default` control per HDMI output, as the HDA
  HDMI codec, ASoC `hdmi-codec` and Intel LPE drivers do. Without the IEC958
  control there is no passthrough on that output; without the ELD only
  `hdmi.passthrough_formats` makes formats available.
* **Audio policy.** No `audio_policy_configuration.xml` is needed: the module
  list, ports and routes come from the HAL. The engine configuration
  (strategies, volume curves) is the AOSP phone example shipped in the APEX; a
  device may override it with its own `audio_policy_engine_configuration.xml`
  in `/vendor/etc`.

## Properties

All keys start with `vendor.audio.mainline.`. They are read once when the HAL
starts.

| Key                       | Type   | Default | Meaning |
|---------------------------|--------|---------|---------|
| `cards`                   | string | *(all non-USB cards)* | Comma separated list of cards to use: index (`0`), id (`PCH`) or name (`HDA Intel PCH`). |
| `wait_for_cards_ms`       | int    | `0`     | Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the cards listed in `cards` to appear before proceeding (0 = no wait, max 60000). Only effective when `cards` is set. |
| `primary_card`            | string | *(auto)* | Card that provides "Speaker" and "Built-In Mic". Auto: first card with an analog output. |
| `include_usb_cards`       | bool   | `false` | Treat USB cards present at boot as static cards instead of leaving them to the framework's USB handling. |
| `null_mic`                | bool   | `false` | Expose a silent built-in mic when no capture path exists (bring-up only). Without it, no built-in mic is declared unless a capture path is found. |
| `ucm.enabled`             | bool   | `true`  | Use UCM profiles when available. |
| `ucm.verb`                | string | `HiFi`  | UCM verb to select (falls back to the first verb of the profile). |
| `mixer.init`              | bool   | `true`  | For cards *without* a UCM profile and for USB cards: unmute and set default volumes at start-up. |
| `mixer.playback_percent`  | int    | `100`   | Playback volume applied by `mixer.init`. |
| `mixer.capture_percent`   | int    | `80`    | Capture volume applied by `mixer.init`. |
| `mixer.toggle`            | bool   | `false` | Turn every switch off and on again in `mixer.init`. For emulated sound cards (QEMU with a host audio backend such as CoreAudio) that apply the mixer to their host stream only when the guest writes it: the guest driver skips a write that does not change its cached value, so the card would never see the unmuted state. |
| `latency_ms`              | int    | `20`    | Nominal stream latency; drives the buffer size negotiated with the framework (5..500). |
| `fast_latency_ms`         | int    | `0`     | 0: no FAST output (the primary output uses `latency_ms`). Above 0 (max 500): `primary output` becomes PRIMARY \| FAST with this latency, so that the framework runs a FastMixer and grants fast tracks. Only effective when the resulting buffer is below the framework's 20 ms normal mixer period at every rate of the port, i.e. up to 10 ms at 44.1 / 48 kHz; otherwise a warning is logged and nothing changes. See "Mix ports". |
| `multichannel`            | bool   | `true`  | Expose a DIRECT "multichannel output" mix port when a device supports 6+ channels. |
| `hdmi.passthrough`        | bool   | `true`  | Expose the `hdmi passthrough` mix port: compressed audio (AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS, ...) sent to the HDMI sink as IEC 61937 for it to decode. See "HDMI passthrough". |
| `hdmi.passthrough_formats`| string | *(ELD)* | Comma separated list of formats to offer instead of those the sink's ELD announces, for sinks or bridges with a missing or wrong ELD: `ac3`, `eac3`, `eac3-joc`, `dts`, and with `ffmpeg_passthrough` also `dtshd`, `dtshd-ma`, `truehd`. |
| `log.verbose`             | bool   | `false` | VERBOSE instead of DEBUG logging. |
| `settings.ignore`         | bool   | `false` | Ignore the settings stored through the settings app (see below); for a device that fails even with confirmed ones. |
| `card.<selector>.rates`   | string | *(all)* | Comma separated list of sample rates to allow for the card matching `<selector>` (card id, index, or name with spaces replaced by underscores). Empty means all rates. |
| `card.<selector>.hbr`     | bool   | *(driver)* | Force high bit rate passthrough (8 channels at 192 kHz of IEC 61937 data, needed for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio) on or off for the HDMI outputs of the card. Unset: on for HDA (Intel, NVIDIA Tegra, ...), where a head that can not do it fails cleanly and is then left out, off for other drivers, which may send garbage instead. |
| `card.<selector>.bits`    | string | *(all)* | Comma separated list of sample widths (`8`, `16`, `24`, `32`) to allow for the card matching `<selector>`; a width keeps every format of that width, so `24` keeps both `S24_3LE` and `S24_LE` and `32` keeps `S32_LE` and `FLOAT_LE`. Empty means all. |
| `card.<selector>.ucm_hda` | bool | `false` | Use alsa-ucm-conf's HDA profile for the card (Intel / AMD HD Audio). The profile is only used when asked for (`HDA=1`, `${var:@HDA}`), so plain HDA cards otherwise run without UCM: one output and one input per PCM device, with the kernel switching between speakers and headphones itself. With it, the card's UCM devices (Speaker, Headphones, Mic, ...) become separate ports, and the framework switches to headphones on its jack events. Not yet verified on hardware. |
| `card.<selector>.ac97_front_panel` | bool | `false` | The PC's front panel is an AC97 one, which has no jack sense lines, like the "AC97 front panel" option of Windows drivers. The HAL marks the front panel headphone and microphone jacks of the card's HD Audio codecs as not detectable before it opens the card. The kernel then stops muting the rear output for them. Without UCM (plain HDA cards) the front headphones share the rear output's PCM and play along with it. With a UCM profile they become a bus output (e.g. "PCH: Headphones") to pick in Default audio devices, since Android can never be told they were plugged in. `false` puts the driver's pin configuration back. See "AC97 front panels". |

## Device model

At start-up the HAL enumerates the sound cards and turns every playback and
capture path into an **endpoint** (`routing/Endpoint.h`), which becomes one
device port. The path comes from the UCM profile of the card when there is one
(the `PlaybackPCM` / `CapturePCM` of each UCM device), otherwise from the PCM
devices of the card with name heuristics ("HDMI", "IEC958", ...).

Every endpoint gets a **role** (`routing/DeviceRole.h`) that decides how
Android sees it:

| Role         | AudioDeviceType / connection | Kind                | Backed by |
|--------------|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Speaker      | `OUT_SPEAKER`                | attached, *default* | UCM "Speaker", else first analog playback PCM of the primary card |
| Earpiece     | `OUT_SPEAKER_EARPIECE`       | attached            | UCM "Earpiece" / "Handset" |
| Headphones   | `OUT_HEADPHONE` / analog     | external template   | UCM "Headphones" |
| Headset      | `OUT_HEADSET` / analog       | external template   | UCM "Headset" playback, or "Headphones" playback when a headset mic is present on the card |
| Line Out     | `OUT_DEVICE` / analog        | external template   | UCM "Line", second analog PCM |
| HDMI         | `OUT_DEVICE` / hdmi          | external template   | UCM "HDMI*", PCMs named HDMI |
| SPDIF        | `OUT_DEVICE` / spdif         | external template   | UCM "SPDIF*", PCMs named IEC958 |
| Bus out      | `OUT_BUS` + address          | attached            | everything else (second cards, extra HDMI ports, ...) |
| Mic          | `IN_MICROPHONE` ("bottom")   | attached, *default* | UCM "Mic" / "Internal Mic", else first analog capture PCM |
| Headset Mic  | `IN_HEADSET` / analog        | external template   | UCM "Headset Mic" |
| Bus in       | `IN_BUS` + address           | attached            | everything else (line in, extra mics, ...) |

Rules applied on top:

* Only the *primary card* provides Speaker, Earpiece and Mic; the same roles
  on other cards become bus ports (`<card id>: <device>`), which apps can
  select explicitly but which never hijack the default routing. Devices of a
  card without UCM that share a PCM name are named after their channel pair
  instead (`CA0106: Front`, `CA0106: Rear`, ...), or numbered.
* The framework can connect only one external device per type, so only the
  highest priority template of each kind is kept; the others become bus ports.
  For HDMI, the template's backing head is chosen from the plugged heads at
  connection / stream routing time (highest priority first). If jack state is
  unavailable, priority is used as a fallback; the extra bus ports remain
  explicitly selectable.
* A UCM headphone playback path with a headset mic also supplies a headset
  output template, unless the card already has a separate headset playback
  path. Android connects the headset output and mic together for a plug with
  a microphone, and the headphone output for a plug without one.
* When the primary card has no speaker / mic, the best remaining path is
  promoted, primary card first, then the other cards. Outputs: line out, a bus
  output, headphones, headset, S/PDIF. Inputs: a bus input, then the headset
  mic. This is how a desktop codec with only a line out still gets a working
  default output. Promoting an external path keeps its template as well, so
  jack events can still connect it even if it also backs the default device.
* HDMI / DisplayPort is never promoted: neither the HDMI template nor the
  additional HDMI / DisplayPort heads, which end up as bus outputs, are
  candidates. A set top box or devkit with HDMI only therefore gets a *null*
  speaker as its default output and plays through the HDMI template once the
  framework reports the sink as connected (see "Jack detection" above).
* Without any sound card, a **null** speaker keeps the HAL and audio policy
  working: playback is discarded. No built-in mic is declared unless
  `null_mic=true`, which exposes a null mic returning silence for bring-up.
  Without any input endpoints, the primary input mix port is omitted; USB
  input remains available through the USB templates, and Bluetooth input
  through the separate Bluetooth module when enabled.
* USB sound cards are *not* enumerated statically. They arrive through
  `connectExternalDevice()` (four USB template ports) with the ALSA card /
  device in the address, exactly like the AOSP USB module.
* Initial port configs are provided only for attached devices. External
  templates get configs after connection, so the framework does not reuse a
  template config when opening a stream on the connected device.

Mix ports:

* `primary output` (PRIMARY): routed to every output device port. Limited to
  the non high resolution part of the capabilities: 8 / 16-bit formats and
  rates below 88.2 kHz (see below for the exception).
  With `fast_latency_ms` set it is also FAST and uses that latency instead of
  `latency_ms`. AudioFlinger creates a FastMixer, and grants
  `AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_FAST` tracks, only when the HAL buffer is smaller than
  its normal mixer period (20 ms), independently of the flag. The buffer
  size the framework gets is derived from the latency by the example HAL
  (rounded up to 16 frames, and to a power of two above 512 frames at
  44.1 kHz and more: at 48 kHz 11..20 ms all give 1024 frames, 10 ms gives
  480), so the flag is only set when the buffer is small enough at every
  rate of the port; otherwise the port stays exactly as without the property.
  The PCM of a FAST stream uses one period per burst, and a warning is logged
  when the driver makes the period longer than a burst (the FastMixer then
  underruns).
  FAST is not a separate mix port on purpose: the policy opens every
  non-direct mix port at start-up, and a second mixed stream on the same
  exclusive PCM device would need a mixer inside the HAL.
* `hra output` (DIRECT | DIRECT_PCM): stereo high resolution playback, only
  24-bit, 32-bit and float formats at 88.2 kHz and above. Routed to the
  outputs that support at least one such format and one such rate; only
  present when such an output exists (no property switch). Being a direct
  port, the framework only uses it for streams that ask for a direct output.
* `multichannel output` (DIRECT): routed to the outputs that accept six or
  more channels; only present when such an output exists.
* `hdmi passthrough` (DIRECT): compressed audio to the HDMI template, see
  "HDMI passthrough". Present when there is an HDMI output and
  `hdmi.passthrough` is set. Its profiles are dynamic: empty until an HDMI
  sink connects, then the formats that sink decodes.
* `primary input`: routed from every input device port; absent when there are none.
* `usb output` / `usb input`: dynamic profiles, routed to the USB templates.

The formats and sample rates of the `primary output`, `hra output`,
`multichannel output` and `primary input` profiles are the *intersection* of
those of the device ports the mix port is routed to, so that the framework
never picks a configuration one of them does not support. The same goes for
the channel count range, within a window per mix port (1..2, 1..2, 3..8 and
1..2): a 5.1 and a 7.1 capable output together get a `multichannel output`
of at most six channels.
16-bit / 44.1 / 48 kHz is added to every probed device (the plug layer can
always serve it), which normally keeps the intersection of the primary ports
non-empty. Should `card.<selector>.rates` / `.bits` leave the device ports of
a primary port with nothing in common, the port falls back to 16-bit at
44.1 / 48 kHz, which the plug layer converts, and a warning is logged; the
optional `hra output` / `multichannel output` are left out in that case.
When those properties leave only high resolution formats (or rates), the
`primary output` keeps them instead of losing every profile.

Multichannel PCM data is reordered from Android's `FL FR FC LFE BL BR (SL SR)`
to ALSA's `FL FR BL BR FC LFE (SL SR)` for 5.1 / 7.1.

## Streams

`stream/StreamMainline.cpp` implements the example HAL's `DriverInterface`.
When a stream is patched, `setConnectedDevices()` resolves the device ports
to endpoints, enables their UCM devices (`routing/RoutingController.cpp`,
reference counted, conflicting UCM devices are disabled first) and posts the
list to the worker thread. The worker opens one PCM per endpoint on the next
`start()` / `transfer()`, so routing changes on a running stream are handled
in place. PCM devices are opened as `hw:` first and fall back to `plughw:`
when the hardware does not accept the requested format / rate / channels
natively, which is what makes an arbitrary card "just work" with the
framework's 48 kHz stereo configuration.

Most PCM devices can be opened by one stream at a time, yet the framework
keeps `primary output` open and routed while a direct output (`hra output`,
`multichannel output`, `hdmi passthrough`) plays to the same device, and writes silence to it for
a few seconds after the last sound. Output streams therefore open such
*exclusive* devices (a hardware PCM with a single substream, identified when
the endpoint is probed) through a shared arbiter (`routing/PcmArbiter.cpp`):

* A direct stream pre-empts a mixed one: the mixed stream is asked to give
  the device up, notices it on its next burst, closes it and keeps running on
  a paced null device (its audio is dropped, its timing kept). The direct
  stream waits for that for up to two of the mixed stream's bursts plus
  100 ms, then gives up.
* When the direct stream closes the device, the mixed stream reopens it on
  its next burst.
* Two direct streams on the same device: the first one wins, the second one
  fails to start.
* Capture streams and devices that allow several streams at once (more than
  one substream, or an alsa-lib plugin such as `dmix`) are not arbitrated.

Positions come from `snd_pcm_status()`; under- and overruns are recovered
with `snd_pcm_prepare()` and counted.

## HDMI passthrough

Compressed streams (AC-3, E-AC-3, E-AC-3 JOC / Atmos, DTS) can be sent to
an HDMI sink (TV, AV receiver) as IEC 61937 data for it to decode, instead of
being decoded to PCM on the device. Applications ask for it with a direct
track of the encoded format (e.g. ExoPlayer passthrough). They may also hand
in data they packed themselves (`ENCODING_IEC61937`), which is passed through
unchanged; stereo, or 7.1 at 192 kHz (high bit rate) when the output can do
it. DTS-HD (High Resolution and Master Audio) and Dolby TrueHD / Atmos are
only packed by the HAL when it is built with `ffmpeg_passthrough`; otherwise
application packed IEC 61937 is the only way to get them to the sink.

When the framework connects the HDMI template, the HAL reads the sink's ELD
(or takes `hdmi.passthrough_formats`), adds a profile per decodable format to
the connected device port and its `encodedFormats` (what the surround sound
settings show), and fills the `hdmi passthrough` mix port with the same
profiles plus IEC 61937 (never PCM). Rates are the ones the sink announces
that the format can be carried at over HDMI: 32 / 44.1 / 48 kHz for AC-3 and
DTS, 44.1 / 48 kHz for E-AC-3, 48 kHz for DTS-HD, 48 / 96 / 192 kHz for
TrueHD. TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio need high bit rate; without it they
are not offered, and DTS-HD goes at four times the content rate on two
channels, where FFmpeg sends only the core of frames that do not fit (Master
Audio ones, typically). The 7.1 IEC 61937 profile is only offered when the
output can do high bit rate.

A passthrough stream packs the data into IEC 61937 bursts (`spdif/`, a fork
of AOSP's libaudiospdif, or FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer for DTS-HD / TrueHD),
sets the IEC 958 channel status of the HDMI output to non-audio, and writes
the bursts to the PCM device, opened without the plug fallback. Its device
goes through the PCM arbiter like any direct stream. When the device refuses
the configuration, the stream tries once more with the driver's own period
and buffer sizes before it fails (the framework then decodes the stream
itself, an application like Kodi plays nothing). A refusal of high bit rate
itself (HDA rejects it when the device is prepared, or the device does not
offer 8 channels at 192 kHz at all) is remembered for the output: it offers
no high bit rate formats any more and DTS-HD falls back to four times the
rate on two channels, until HDMI connects again. Positions are frames of the content at its sample rate, what
applications expect from a direct encoded track. The stream buffer holds
`latency_ms` of the IEC 61937 stream the format becomes. `drain` drops a
partial burst still held by the packer; `pause` lets the device run dry.

The HAL packs IEC 61937 itself instead of leaving it to AudioFlinger's
fallback (`SpdifStreamOut`), which only knows AC-3 / E-AC-3 / DTS core and
reopens the mix port as plain PCM, so the HAL could not set the channel
status.

### Hardware notes

* **HDA** (Intel, NVIDIA Tegra `tegra-hda`, ...): primary target, NVIDIA
  Tegra being the hardware the feature is developed on. The ELD is a PCM
  control of the HDMI PCM device, the IEC958 controls are mixer controls
  numbered by HDMI PCM. High bit rate needs pin support (and, on Tegra 20 /
  30, is not available at all); the driver then refuses it when the device
  is prepared, which the HAL remembers per output. Mainline checks the pin's
  `HBR` capability (`/proc/asound/card<N>/codec#*`), which the Tegra 210
  pin does not report although NVIDIA's downstream kernel sends high bit
  rate on it; the HAL only shows the capability next to the high bit rate
  state.
* **ASoC `hdmi-codec`** (e.g. Amlogic through `dw-hdmi`): expected to work
  for everything but high bit rate, not tested. On DPCM cards the controls
  sit on an internal back-end PCM, so the HAL uses the card's only ELD /
  IEC958 control. High bit rate is off unless `card.<selector>.hbr` is set:
  the I2S bridge does not know it and may send garbage.
* **Qualcomm DisplayPort** (`msm_dp`): not supported, the driver never
  programs the channel status and the DSP path is not known to be bit exact.

## Debugging

```sh
adb logcat -s MainlineAudio_Main MainlineAudio_Inventory MainlineAudio_Ucm \
    MainlineAudio_Stream MainlineAudio_AlsaPcm MainlineAudio_Routing \
    MainlineAudio_PcmArbiter MainlineAudio_Passthrough
adb shell dumpsys android.hardware.audio.core.IModule/default
setprop vendor.audio.mainline.log.verbose true   # then restart the HAL
```

The `dumpsys` output starts with the effective properties, the cards, every
endpoint with its capabilities, the UCM devices currently enabled and which
stream owns which exclusive PCM device.

## Settings app and control interface

The APEX carries a settings app, `MainlineAudioSettings`, shown as
**Settings › Sound › Audio › Audio hardware**, and the product should also
install `MainlineAudioRouting` (**Default audio devices**), which needs a
permission an app in a vendor APEX can never hold; see
[`settings/README.md`](settings/README.md). The APEX app needs the device's
SELinux policy to give it a domain (vendor `seapp_contexts`).

`vendor.mainline.audio.IControl/default` (`aidl/`) serves the settings app;
the framework does not use it. Besides reading the HAL's state it adjusts
ALSA mixer controls; values set that way are stored in
`/data/vendor/mainline_audio` and applied again at every start and whenever
UCM enables a device on the card (UCM sequences set the controls they know
about, which would otherwise undo the user's choice). It reports the cards,
their UCM verb and enabled devices, and every endpoint with its path,
capabilities, jack state, stream usage and, for HDMI heads, the sink's
passthrough formats, plus a plain text report (`dumpsys` output, and from
`/proc/asound` the cards, the PCM devices, the HDMI sinks' ELDs and the HDA
codecs, whose pin capabilities tell whether HDMI can do high bit rate).

Every setting of the table above (except `settings.ignore`) can also be set
through `IControl`, which stores it in `/data/vendor/mainline_audio`; a
stored setting wins over the property. Since settings only apply when the HAL
starts, new ones run as a trial: the HAL restarts with them (and audioserver
with it) and keeps them only once the app confirms. It drops them and
restarts with the previous ones when that does not happen within 30 seconds,
or when it failed to come up with them twice. A device that fails even with
confirmed settings starts without them while `settings.ignore` is set.

### Output processing

Each output can process what it plays, set per output through `IControl`
and applied right away, also to playing streams:

* **Speaker layout** (stereo, quad, 5.1, 7.1, or *auto*: the stream's own
  channels). The PCM device is opened with the layout's channel count, and
  streams are mixed to it: missing speakers are downmixed (ITU style
  coefficients), and with *speaker fill* a stereo stream also drives the
  rears, centre and subwoofer.
* **Bass management:** with a subwoofer, *small speakers* moves their bass
  below the crossover (40 to 250 Hz, 4th order Linkwitz-Riley) to the LFE
  channel. Without a subwoofer, the stream's LFE goes to the fronts.
* **Swap left / right, mono**, and per speaker **level** (-30 to +10 dB) and
  **delay** (0 to 20 ms, room correction).
* **Test tone:** pink noise on one speaker, while a stream plays to the
  output.

Processing works in float on the PCM formats the HAL plays and adds no
latency beyond the configured delays. It never touches passthrough. An output
left at the defaults is not processed at all. The settings are stored by
path (`EndpointStatus.key`), so they follow the card when its index changes.

The device's SELinux policy has to label `/data/vendor/mainline_audio`
for the HAL to write it; without it nothing is kept across restarts.

Version 2 of the interface adds HDMI and low latency diagnostics: what
decided high bit rate (the driver, the card setting or a refusal) and a way
to forget refusals, the last passthrough stream of each HDMI output and why
it failed, a probe that opens an idle HDMI output with each IEC 61937
configuration (2 channels at 48 and 192 kHz, 8 channels at 192 kHz) without
playing anything, whether `fast_latency_ms` gave the primary output a
FastMixer and which period FAST streams got, and the mixed streams a direct
stream silences.

Version 1 is frozen; version 2 is not frozen yet. The product has to install its framework
compatibility matrix entry, `framework_compatibility_matrix.mainline.audio.xml`
(on `/product`), so that VINTF checks know the HAL; the device's SELinux
policy decides who may use the service.

## Known limitations

* No telephony (`ITelephony` is null): voice calls need modem specific paths.
* No compressed offload, no MMAP / AAudio exclusive mode, no FAST capture.
* While a direct output (`hra output`, `multichannel output`, `hdmi
  passthrough`) plays to a device, the system sounds and any other mixed
  audio routed to the same PCM device are dropped rather than mixed in.
  Mixing them into the direct stream is not implemented (and impossible for
  passthrough).
* HDMI passthrough: DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD only with the
  `ffmpeg_passthrough` build option (or application packed IEC 61937); no
  S/PDIF passthrough, no
  AC-4, DTS:X (DTS-UHD) or MPEG-H, no high bit rate for the 44.1 kHz rate
  family (IEC 60958 channel
  status has no code for 705.6 kHz), and no formats beyond what the ELD
  announces other than through `hdmi.passthrough_formats` (the framework's
  "always" / "manual" surround modes have nothing more to choose from). The
  sink is read when HDMI connects, not while it stays connected.
* Master volume and mute are reported as unsupported; the framework applies
  them in software.
* HDMI / DisplayPort connection state is not announced by the HAL (the AIDL
  interface has no way for a HAL to announce a device). The HDMI template is
  only connected when the framework learns about the sink (see "Jack
  detection"); additional HDMI / DisplayPort heads are reachable as bus
  ports. Jack state is sampled when connecting or routing the template, not
  monitored while a stream is active; changing heads without a new patch
  does not reroute it. HDMI is never promoted to the default output, so an
  HDMI-only device without such reporting stays on the null speaker.
* Cards that appear after the HAL started are not picked up (USB excepted).
